Welcome to my `personal-website`'s github repo. This is my webfolio that I created for myself using NextJS and Chakra UI. I've added a blog section where I post about my personal experiences in life, tech, design, finance and much much more. I always wanted to build my own webfolio and publish blogs under my own domain, so here it is finally!! 🚀

## 📄 License

The poject is open-sourced under MIT License 🥳. Feel free to clone the repo but make sure to include this [LICENSE](LICENSE) file wherever you use my code. But before you clone make sure you ⭐ this repo.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| System      | Stack       |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| Frontend    | ReactJs     |
| Framework   | NextJs      |
| Design      | Chakra UI   |
| Blogging    | Next MDX    |
| Mailing     | EmailJs     |
| Analytics   | Splitbee    |
| Hosting     | Vercel      |
| Comments    | Utterances  |


## ✨ Features

Not features really but here are few sections I've added in the landing page:

- Home
- About
- Experience
- Work
- Contact
- Blog

> I'm planning to move the blog section under a seperate project and host it under the sub-domain 👉 `blog.prajwalsv.dev` in the near future so that I can integrate certain features and deploy commits independently.

And also design for a few more sections like `Skills`, `Achievments` & `Academics` are in-progress. So... expect a refactor and more sections soon.

NextJs does most of the work for a developer under the hood and performance is by default in every NextJs project! Chakra UI offers a good responsive design system with customizable break points.

## 💅 Colors

The project supports both light & dark modes. I've managed to use only neutral colors in the light mode but the dark mode comes with primary color and uses less of neutral color and colors that blend well together in dark mode. I've listed all the colors used below in both themes.
